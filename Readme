Development
Start the Local Development Server
To start the development server and view the app in your browser:

bash
Copy
npm start
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

The development server supports hot reloading, so changes will automatically reflect in the browser.

Build the Project
To create an optimized production build:

bash
Copy
npm run build
The build files will be generated in the build folder.

This folder contains the static files (HTML, CSS, JS) ready for deployment.

Deployment
Deploy to GitHub Pages
To deploy the app to GitHub Pages:

Ensure the homepage field in package.json is set to your GitHub Pages URL:

json
Copy
"homepage": "https://pramudithan.github.io/portfolio"
Run the deployment command:

bash
Copy
npm run deploy
This will build the project and push the build folder contents to the gh-pages branch.

Enable GitHub Pages:

Go to your repository's Settings > Pages.

Select the gh-pages branch as the source.

Your app will be live at:

Copy
https://pramudithan.github.io/portfolio
